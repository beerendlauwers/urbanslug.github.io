 **Conclusion.**
 ---------------
 
+I give Obama a lot more respect now than I did before.
+I really now see what he has to put up with. It is a shame that such had to happen for me to see that he really is worth more than what we give him credit for.
+He surely puts on a brave front. I can only thank him for what he has done for black people in showing that they too can do something worthwhile just like anybody else.

 I believe that nobody is worth more than the other or worth more than anything else. Whether because of your species, you race, morphology, education, money  et cetera. All life is sacred.
 
 I wish African would stop opressing each other and for once help each other rise from the poverty.
