My error:
Unable to open account Gmail:         mwanikibusiness@gmail.com: The name org.freedesktop.secrets was not provided by any .     service files

This is weird for me because I have always hated using KDE wallet. It seems that this app stores your passwords using gnome keyring so you will have to be on gnome or install gnome keyring which can work without gnome.

1. Install geary from AUR.
2. Add the following to your ~/.xinitrc
``` bash
  # Start a D-Bus session
  source /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/30-dbus
  # Start GNOME Keyring
  eval $(/usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon --start --components=gpg,pkcs11,secrets,ssh)
  # You probably need to do this too:
   export GNOME_KEYRING_CONTROL GNOME_KEYRING_PID GPG_AGENT_INFO SSH_AUTH_SOCK
 ```



If you had any issue running Geary run geary --debug > geary.log
Mine looked like this:

 I fixed that issue with the help of this: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1339646

 whose issue was:

Take note of the second line. That is most probably a gnome-keyring issue. I hope these guys add is as a dependency soon but about editing your ~/.xinitirc and adding that I don't know yet.
