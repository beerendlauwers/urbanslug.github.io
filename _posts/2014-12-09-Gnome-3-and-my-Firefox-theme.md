I didn't make this theme (misleading title). This first paragraph is more of a reminder to myself. About this firefox theme: it makes firefox blend perfectly into the default Gnome 3 theme (I assume I am using the default theme). It's called Glass-Black by jmouse888 whose description is.

I've used the usual ones xfce, KDE, MATE, Cinnamon, and a little unity in the past.

Then I used xmonad on top of xorg without a Desktop Manager. It wasn't fun. It felt like I was spending too much time writing scripts to do things that I knew makers of DEs have done better and I used the terminal instead of shortcuts a lot. Anyway, I didn't work for me.

Now I'm on Gnome 3 and do I say. This Desktop Environment (DE) is the best I've used. As far as compatibilty with devices goes (compatibilty is a major linux issue). It works with just about everything out of the box like projectors (something KDE didn't do). I haven't tried it with HDMI yet but if it worked with a random Sony projector it will most likely work. I have GTK apps for just about everything so I don't have to worry about themes for GTK or Qt and what not. This means more time spent doing actual work and not tweaking my system. This must be what mac users feel like. That wasn't a compliment. I hate apple.

Apps I have liked: Rhythmbox for music and NOT Gnome music. Gnome music is the not okay to use right now because it's still in active development. It failed in listing tracks as I wanted it to or sometimes not playing music. I felt that it did other things well like fetch album art and looking preety instead of playing music when I wanted it to, also no scrobbling yet :-(. Though I will use it as soon it goes stable and hopefully stick to it.

Bottomline, I've found home and if by any chance I ditch Gnome 3 I'll probably look for something close to what I with is xmonad on xorg but with wayland instead of xorg. Hope I get to try wayland soon.


Fun times :-)
