This photograpgh is proof enough that proving your worth while being black no matter what or who you are is not easy.
There are people who believe that being black is abominable.
Those people will never think you are worth much no matter what you do.
And there are tons of them in many parts of this world.

It affects your chances of success in life, how much you earn, where you can comfortably go or not go e.t.c. So it fucking matters.

What does his wife have to do with it anyway? Fucking wrong!
With his wife in it you can't claim that it was satirical as idiots on twitter shall claim.

It's sad. It's fucking wrong.

I believe that nobody is worth more than the other or worth more than anything else. Whether because of your species, you race, morphology et cetera. All life is sacred.

I also wish they'd stop opressing each other and for once help each other rise from the shaming poverty.

I wish more and more Africans would know this when lynching gay people.
